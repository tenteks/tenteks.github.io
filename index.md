# My Website

Welcome to my website!

## About Me

I am a web developer and designer with a passion for creating beautiful and user-friendly websites. I have been working in the industry for over 5 years and have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## My Work

Here are some examples of my work:

### Project 1

[Live Demo](https://www.example.com) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/username/project-1)

This was a project I completed for a client. It was a redesign of their existing website to make it more modern and responsive. I used HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript to create the site.

### Project 2

[Live Demo](https://www.example.com) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/username/project-2)

This was a personal project I worked on to practice my skills and try out some new technologies. It's a simple to-do list app built with React and Firebase.
